# Grey Matter Operator

Grey Matter Operator is a Kubernetes operator that watches for install.greymatter.io/v1.Mesh CR (Custom Resource) objects in a Kubernetes cluster and installs the core Grey Matter services into the same namespace where the Mesh CR exists. Grey Matter Operator also spawns a process that will call the Control API to configure routing for each installed core service.

## Important Files

- [api/v1/mesh_types.go](api/v1/mesh_types.go): Used to generate the Mesh CRD. Every time this is updated, run `make generate` and `make manifests`.
- [config/crd/bases/install.greymatter.io_meshes.yaml](config/crd/bases/install.greymatter.io_meshes.yaml): The Mesh CRD generated by `make manifests`.
- [controllers/mesh_controller.go](controllers/mesh_controller.go): Logic for what to do when a Mesh CR is created/updated (e.g. deploy and configure the mesh).
- [controllers/reconciler.go](controllers/reconciler.go): A custom interface with methods for reconciling Kubernetes resources based on configuration passed in from a Mesh CR. See the `reconcilers` directory for how this interface is implemented for each Kubernetes resource.
- [controllers/gmcore/gmcore.go](controllers/gmcore/gmcore.go): This package defines configuration for each version of Grey Matter and is still a work in progress. The idea is that based on the desired version of Grey Matter, configurations will be applied starting with `base.go` and then continuing with either `version_1_2.go` or `version_1_3.go` as overlays.

## Getting Started

This assumes you have at least Go 1.15, K3d, and kubectl installed.

1. Download Go dependencies: `go mod vendor`
2. Build the Docker image: `make docker-build`
3. Push the Docker image to Nexus: `make docker-push`
4. Make a K3d cluster: `make k3d`
5. Set your `KUBECONFIG` to it: `export KUBECONFIG=$(k3d kubeconfig write gm-operator)`
6. Store your Grey Matter LDAP credentials in the environment variables `NEXUS_USER` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD` and then run the create script to create a secret for pulling Docker images: `./create-docker-secret.sh`

*NOTE: The Docker secret is created in the `default` namespace for now, although later on we'd want to create it in the `gm-operator-system` namespace so that the Operator can re-create the secret in each namespace where a Mesh CR is deployed.*

Then to deploy:

1. Deploy to the K3d cluster: `make deploy`.
2. Create a Mesh CR: `make sample`
3. Check the Mesh CR: `kubectl get mesh sample-mesh -o yaml`

The mesh will then be available via `localhost:30000

## Cleanup

1. `make remove-sample`
2. `make undeploy`
3. `make destroy`
